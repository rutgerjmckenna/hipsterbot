# Hipsterbot!

This repo uses a Spotify API token that is private to me in the development stage. The application allows the user to connect their Spotify account to and see what is currently playing, and then take the robotic hipsters suggestion to find a song they may have not heard of!

Using a custom algorithm rather than what Spotify provides, this app uses a JSX library to search the Spotify API to find less popular yet higher rated tracks to what you're currently listening to. You can even hit the suggest button multiple times to get different tracks all related to what is currently playing.

The suggestion will tell you a small breakdown of the songs audio and allow the user to upload the new find to a playlist on their Spotify in real time.

This is all while the disgusting yet irresistable CSS makes you fall into a neon early 2000's era mood ~~~
